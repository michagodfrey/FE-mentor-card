### What I learned

My first Frontend Mentor challenge! This was the first time I got experience how hard it can be to center elements. Also the the background has some subtle effects that are tricky for newbies but I gave it a solid effort and made something pretty decent for a first challenge.

In response to the excellent feedback I was fortunate to receive, I have addressed the accessibility and some other issues.

## Acknowledgments

The pseduo element styles used for the background images were made following the example of Web Wizard's [@rsrclab's solution](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/profile-card-solution-m-cH4D2Lp).
